# SST25VF080B
SPI Driver for SST25VF080B EEPROM
Datasheet located at https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20005045D.pdf

I was looking for an SPI driver for this EEPROM for my project to record flight data on an autonomous scale model of SpaceX Starship

This one works with my teensy 4.0. It should be compatible with any arduino board that can use the SPI library in Arduino.
